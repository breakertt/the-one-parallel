# the-one-parallel

The one parallel is an easy to use high-performance launcher for [the-one](https://github.com/akeranen/the-one).

**Windows support only now, Linux coming soon.**

## Intro

This launcher is design to run multiple instances of the-one simulation, using up your CPU resource to get results faster. It is not "dark magic" but a very simple tool, hope you can enjoy it.

## Download

Releases are available at [here](https://github.com/imaginebreake/the-one-parallel/releases).

## Usage

You need to write your scenario config files like before, except for **Scenario.name** key which will be generated by this tool.

Generally, you just need to do slightly change compared to use the-one batch mode:
```
# the-one
one.bat -b 1 my_settings.txt
# the-one-parallel
onepara.exe -b 1 -c my_settings.txt
```

There are also other configurations you can set:
```

  -n string
